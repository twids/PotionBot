# PotionBot - Quick Summary

## What It Does
PotionBot automatically creates and maintains two macros (`HealthPotionBot` and `ManaPotionBot`) that always use the best available potions in your bags.

## Key Features
- **Smart Detection**: Scans bags for health/mana potions, elixirs, and flasks
- **Priority System**: Healthstones > Health Potions, Mana Gems > Mana Potions
- **Auto-Update**: Macros refresh when you loot new items or change bags
- **One-Click Use**: Bind the macros to keys for instant potion consumption
- **Multi-Version**: Works on Classic Era, Cataclysm Classic, and Retail WoW

## Installation
1. Extract to `Interface/AddOns/PotionBot/`
2. Restart WoW or `/reload`
3. Type `/pb` to configure
4. Bind the created macros to your action bars

## Usage
- The addon creates two macros automatically: `HealthPotionBot` and `ManaPotionBot`
- Drag these macros to your action bars or bind them to keys
- Use them like any other button - they'll always use your best available potion
- Configure which types of potions to prioritize with `/pb` or `/potionbot`
